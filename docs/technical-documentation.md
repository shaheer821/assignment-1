# What I built
I made a personal portfolio website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has three main sections. 

# Technologies
- HTML 
- CSS 
- JavaScript 

# Features
- Dark and light mode toggle button
- Smooth scrolling when you click navigation links
- Contact form that checks if you filled everything out
- Different greeting depending on what time it is
- Works on mobile phones and tablets

# How its responsive
- Used CSS flexbox for the navigation
- Used CSS grid for the projects section
- Added media queries to make it work on smaller screens
- Made sure buttons are big enough to tap on phones
